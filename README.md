It’s a mix of setup information and a lightweight case study, intended as
practical reference rather than a step‑by‑step tutorial.

## What’s here

- **Setup notes** — how I configured and started using GitHub Spec Kit
- **Case study** — how I applied it in practice, what worked, and what didn’t
- **Observations** — patterns, limitations, and takeaways from actual use

## Contents

- Case study

## Audience

This is aimed at people who are:
- Curious about GitHub Spec Kit

- Looking for real‑world usage notes rather than polished documentation

## Status
